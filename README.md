# Godot-4.0-Text-Editor-Docker
Allows you to add a docker in the editor that can be used to edit scripts


Currently this addon is not in working condition! I am working on a newer version with a similar implimentation.
but I would recommend people interested in a similar feature check out https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1848

https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1848 adds a popout button to the top right corner of the script editor allowing you to popout the main script editor into a floating window!
